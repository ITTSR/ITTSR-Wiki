Movement to next gate. Destroy gate.
May shoots thing to open third gate. Enter to get checkpoint. Cody blobs ramp thingy. Both stand on it. May shoots ramp thingy, Cody blobs elevator platform. Get to platform, shoot thingy in middle, and explain early jump with that height momentum.

## After MGW

<Table>
<Either>
Shoot gate. Move OOB. Explain oob path. Is an extremely hard backup if other player doesn't hit rail clip, but might be out of scope for this guide? Potentially link to it on a separate strats page.

Hit final trigger after other player hits their trigger.
</Either>
<Either>
Blob up gate. 

:::caution FOR AUTHORS
Wasn't there a way to get over the gate without destroying it too? Explain that as well maybe?
:::

Explain getting to branch. Movement over branch, and where to jump back to hit checkpoint/spawn trigger.

Explain rail clip, and the movement after. If you can't do rail clip just do normal rails?

If other player hasn't reached their spot OOB, explain backup strat with RCP? (Inbounds way: Wasp fight).
Solo co-op backup as well?
