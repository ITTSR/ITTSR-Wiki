Both players need to hit all the checkpoints.

Explain backup if you fall between the wall and the checkpoint invisible wall stuff.

(Is there a backup if you actually fall inbounds?)

### Second checkpoint
Explain movement to second checkpoint.

Explain backups.

### Third checkpoint
Explain movement to third checkpoint.

Explain backups.

### Final checkpoint
Explain movement to final checkpoint.

Are there any backups??
