# ðŸ”§ Tools

We have several tools you can use that makes practicing the game a lot easier. Let's start with the dev menu.

:::note
Keep in mind that only PC has access to these tools, there's no way to use any of these on consoles.
:::

## Dev Menu

To access the dev menu, you're gonna need to launch *It Takes Two* with the `-devmenu` command line argument.
There are multiple ways to do this, depending on where you bought your game.

### Steam

Right click *It Takes Two* and select `Properties...`\
Under the **GENERAL** tab, add `-devmenu` into the launch options.

### Origin

Find *It Takes Two* and click the settings cogwheel next to "play", then select `Game Properties`\
Under the **ADVANCED LAUNCH OPTIONS** tab, add `-devmenu` into the command line arguments.

### EA Launcher

Right click *It Takes Two* and select `View properties`\
Add `-devmenu` into the advanced launch options.

If you have the game through the Xbox Game Pass, there doesn't seem to be anywhere you can set a command line argument.
However, we can try doing it the good old fashioned way.

<Table>

- Find your *It Takes Two* installation directory
- Navigate to `ItTakesTwo\Nuts\Binaries\Win64`
- Right click `ItTakesTwo.exe` and click `Create shortcut`
- Right click the shortcut that was just created, and click `Properties`
- At the end of the `Target:` box, add `-devmenu`\
\
And you should be good to launch the game!

### How to open the dev menu

Now that you have enabled the dev menu, go ahead and enter the game.
In your pause menu, you should now have an extra button that says "(DEV) Open Developer Menu". That should open up the `Levels` tab of the dev menu, and this lets you teleport to any checkpoint in the game! Pretty neat right?

The dev menu does have some other information and things that can be helpful when routing, but I'll go into more detail about the dev menu [here](/docs/category/dev-menu). By default the dev menu is only available in the pause menu, but there is a way to enable it in the main menu, which brings us over to...

## Speedtools

What are speedtools?
Speedtools is an angelscript mod that lets you:
- Save your positon
- Teleport to your saved position
- Teleport to your partner
- Save and load a checkpoint
- Show volumes
- Use the dev menu in the main menu

There are two ways to install speedtools. Let's start with the easiest one:

### Automatic

This uses the [Angelscript Mod Installer](https://github.com/Lemuura/ITTAS-Installer/releases/) to install speedtools. Glint has a video that covers how to install and what you can do with speedtools here:
<YouTube youTubeId="G3F9VngySME"/>

:::caution

:::

### Manual
#### Installation
Here's how to manually install the latest version of speedtools yourself.
First things first, you're going to want the latest version of speedtools, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Lemuura/It-Takes-Two-Mods/releases).

Navigate to your It Takes Two installation folder. In steam for example, you can find this folder by right clicking It Takes Two, select Manage then Browse Local Files. Once you have found your installation folder, find the `ItTakesTwo\Nuts\Script` folder.

Open the Speedtools.zip file you downloaded earlier, and inside it you will find 3 folders: Rice, Speed and Vino. Drag these into the Script folder you just opened up, and click "Replace the files in the destination" when that prompt shows up.

Next, if you have a file called `PrecompiledScript.Cache` in your Script folder, either delete it or create a new folder called `PrecompiledScript` and move it in there. Moving or deleting this file forces the game to compile the entire script folder when the game starts, letting you use speedtools.

#### Settings

If you want to change the speedtools settings, open the `Speed` folder and open `SpeedSettings.as` in a text editor. Inside this file you should see the following lines of code: 
```
const bool SpeedToolsActiveOnLaunch = false;

const FName SaveState1 = ActionNames::SwingAttach;
const FName SaveState2 = ActionNames::FindOtherPlayer;
const FName LoadState1 = ActionNames::MovementSprintToggle;
const FName LoadState2 = ActionNames::SwingAttach;
const FName TeleportOther1 = ActionNames::Cancel;
const FName TeleportOther2 = ActionNames::FindOtherPlayer;
```

Change `SpeedToolsActiveOnLaunch` to true if you want speedtools to be active when you launch the game. If it's set to false, you will have to enable it in the dev menu functions.

The other settings indicate the first and second input you're going to need to do to do these actions.
Here's a list of ActionNames you can choose from, as well as their default actual keybinds:
```
"ActionNames::MovementSprintToggle"         Default keybind: Caps Lock
"ActionNames::MovementJump"                 Default keybind: Space
"ActionNames::MovementDash"                 Default keybind: Left Shift
"ActionNames::MovementCrouch"               Default keybind: Ctrl
"ActionNames::InteractionTrigger"           Default keybind: E
"ActionNames::SwingAttach"                  Default keybind: F
"ActionNames::WeaponFire"                   Default keybind: Left Mouse Button
"ActionNames::WeaponAim"                    Default keybind: Right Mouse Button
"ActionNames::FindOtherPlayer"              Default keybind: Middle Mouse Button
"ActionNames::Cancel"                       Default keybind: Q
"ActionNames::GUIOk"                        Default keybind: Enter
"ActionNames::MusicFlyingTightTurnRight"    Default keybind: C
```

:::info NOTE
Down the line I will probably change the settings file to be more user friendly for manual editing. I would highly suggest using the Mod Manager to easily set your keybinds for speedtools. As of right now there's no way to add manual keybinds (e.g. F1 or H), and we have to use the predefined ActionNames.

#### How to view volumes
To let you view volumes (things like checkpoint triggers, death planes, invisible walls etc), you're going to need to edit the Engine.ini file. To find the Engine.ini file, paste this into the address bar of windows explorer: `%localappdata%\ItTakesTwo\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`

![](img/engineIniLocation.png)

Then open the Engine.ini file here in a text editor, and add the following:
```
[/script/engine.renderersettings]
r.ForceDebugViewModes=1
```

I usually add this to the top of the file, but it doesn't really matter where you add it, as long as you keep an empty line between this and the next and previous section.
The file should look something like this:

![](img/engineIni.png)

:::tip NOTE
The extra D3D12 lines you see in the screenshot is added to improve FPS rates and consistency. For more information about DX12 and ITT, go here. TODO: INSERT LINK

### How to use speedtools

To enable or disable speedtools while in game, head over to the functions tab of the dev menu and press the "Speedtools" button.

#### Save states
For the rest of this guide I'm going to assume you're using the default speedtool settings and in-game keybindings. 

- To save your position, press F, then MMB.
- To teleport to your saved position, press Caps Lock, then F.
- To teleport to your partner, press Q, then MMB.

This also works with vehicles, for example the frogs in Frog Pond and the plane in Getaway.

#### Volumes
You can bind the ability to toggle volumes on or off to a key. 
To do this, open the dev menu, and head to the functions tab. Hover over the "Show_Volumes" function on either May or Cody, hold Ctrl and then any button you want to bind it to. 
To show volumes, either click the "Show_Volumes" button in the dev menu, or use your keybind.

:::info NOTE
If you can't see any volumes, refer to the [How to view volumes](/docs/tutorials/welcome/tools#how-to-view-volumes) section above.
:::

There are a lot of different volumes, and you can distinguish most of them by their colour:
- Pink outlines can mean a couple of different things, as it seems to be the default colour.
    - Player based triggers
    - Checkpoints
    - Collision
    - Minigames
- Blue outlines are physics objects.
- Green outlines are for camera control.
- Red outlines are death planes.
- Teal outlines are spawn boxes.

#### Checkpoint save and load

Similar to volumes, you can assign these to keys in the functions tab of the dev menu.
Pressing "Save_Checkpoint" will store your current checkpoint.
Pressing "Load_Checkpoint" will load the stored checkpoint.

This feature is pretty self explanatory, but it's extremely useful for practicing things such as Pocket Watch room, or 100% where you collect multiple checkpoints in a row.

#### Misc

You can swap the control input of either character by clicking the "SwapControllers" button in the functions tab of the dev menu. Note that this only works in local.
