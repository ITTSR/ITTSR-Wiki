# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

If strats for a specific segment are different for May and Cody, you will see the strats in the following boxes:
<Table><May></May><Cody></Cody></Table>
<br></br>
  
Strats will also be in one of these color coded boxes to give you a rough idea for the difficulty.

:::easy
:::
:::medium
:::
:::hard
:::

Sometimes there will also be a comment from one or more authors if there is anything worth knowing. Usually this'll be an estimate for when a particularly hard strat is worth going for.
