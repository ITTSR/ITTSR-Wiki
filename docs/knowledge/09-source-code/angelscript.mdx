# Angelscript

The majority of It Takes Two's gameplay is written in angelscript, a scripting language for Unreal Engine that is made by Hazelight.
For more information about angelscript, please check out Hazelight's official documentation [here](https://angelscript.hazelight.se/).

The angelscript source code is located in your It Takes Two installation folder at `ItTakesTwo\Nuts\Script`.
The script folder is split up into a lot of smaller folders, each of them serving a different purpose in script, which I'll list here:

:::info Cake
Cake systems are large gameplay sections that span longer amounts of time and involve a lot of systems to create coherent experience.
:::

:::info Editor
Editor only scripts
:::

:::info Effects
:::

:::info Examples
A folder containing example scripts and templates.
:::

:::info Peanuts
Peanuts systems are small, self-contained building blocks with strict specifications of behavior.
These building blocks can then reliably be used to construct larger Vino and Cake systems.
:::

:::info Rice
Rice systems do not relate directly to gameplay or level design, but are still required to implement specific other systems.
:::

:::info Tulip
:::

:::info Vino
Vino systems represent distinct gameplay moments that can used in levels or by larger Cake systems.

If you are using Angelscript mods, you'll likely see a `Mods` or `Speed` folder as well. These have been added by us for organizations sake.
