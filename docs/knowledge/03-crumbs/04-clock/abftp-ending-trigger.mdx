The ending trigger in A Blast from the Past is always active. If you can somehow get there, we could skip the whole "boss fight" segment. 

There's a few things preventing us from reaching it in any obvious way:
- The camera lock makes it awkward to do any OOB movement.
- There's no clear geometry that could take us over there.
- The death plane in this area is based on your last safe position. TODO: Show code and why
    - This is why you have to use the floating platforms that Cody uses to get safely to the end. If you jumped off early you'll die before reaching it.
