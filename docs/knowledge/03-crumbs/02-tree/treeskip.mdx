# Tree skip?

:::info Theoretical timesave: Around 13 minutes.
:::

The interrogation cutscene (where the squirrels interrogate you when you enter Captured) and the flight cutscene (as you enter Getaway, with the bee) happens in the same map "SquirrelTurf". This map is only used for these cutscenes.

The interrogation cutscene takes place when the "SquirrelTurf_WarRoom_BP" level is loaded, and the flight cutscene takes place when the "SquirrelTurf_Flight_BP" level is loaded. If you could somehow trigger the wrong cutscene you could in theory skip almost all of tree, skipping the Captured, Deeply Rooted and Extermination subchapters.

:::note
**IF** triggering the wrong cutscene in this manner is possible, then this *could* also apply to the "RealWorld" or "TherapyRoom" map. Any cutscene that takes place between chapters happens in either of those maps.
